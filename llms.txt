# Rubrik Security Cloud

## Getting Started

The Rubrik Security Cloud (RSC) API provides programatic access to all management within Rubrik.

### GraphQL Features

1. Single Endpoint - The RSC API endpoint will always be `/api/graphql`.
1. Single HTTP method - Everything is HTTP POST.
1. Introspection - The API documentation is built in to the API itself, providing integrated development help and schema checking.
1. Customized Response - Queries are customized to only return the fields that is needed.

## GraphQL Basics

GraphQL is a "query language" comparable to SQL. In SQL, one might say, "Select name and ID from the VM table." GraphQL is similar in this idea. A query is much like a SQL table. Properties (called fields in GraphQL) are like columns in that table. Unlike SQL, GraphQL fields can be complex types with their own fields, allowing functionality of a SQL join.

### Example

Click on the arrow annotation (1) in the code to see an explanation of that part of the code.

1. This is an annotation!

> Retrieve all MSSQL databases, and return the name, ID, and the name and ID of the Rubrik Cluster that protect's this MSSQL database.

```graphql
query mssqlDatabasesExample { #(1)!
  mssqlDatabases { # (2)!
    nodes  { #(3)!
      name #(4)! 
      id
      cluster { #(5)!
        name #(6)!
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

1. `mssqlDatabasesExample` is an operation name, You can change this to whatever you want.
1. `mssqlDatabases` is the name of the query in the API.
1. `nodes` is a paginated array of objects, in this case, mssqlDatabases.
1. `name` is a property, known as a `field` in GraphQL. It has a specific type, in this case `name` is a `String`.
1. `cluster` is also a field in the API, but unlike `name` that is of type `String`, `cluster` is a `Cluster` type, and it has its own fields.
1. This is the cluster `name` field. It's a field on the `Cluster` type in the API.

To learn more about the query syntax, check out [GraphQL Language Syntax](https://graphql.org/learn/queries).

Next: [API Playground](https://developer.rubrik.com/Rubrik-Security-Cloud-API/API-playground/index.md)

The API Playground is an integrated development environment (IDE) that you can use to browse, explore, and run GraphQL APIs offered by Rubrik Security Cloud (RSC). The IDE also provides reference to the Rubrik GraphQL API documentation for your version. Running GraphQL queries and mutations in API Playground validates the GraphQL operations so that you can confirm that your queries or mutations will achieve the desired result when included in automation scripts.

Initially, access to the playground uses the currently authenticated user credentials. Running queries as a service account is useful for testing permissions and can be accomplished by clicking the "Test with Service Account" button in the upper right of the Playground.

The ability to access objects and queries depends on the RBAC roles assigned to the user account or service account. For enhanced security, API Playground does not persist the service account access credentials.

Danger

The GraphQL mutations that run in API Playground perform actions against this instance of RSC. This can result in data loss.

## Accessing API Playground

Access the API Playground through the RSC Settings menu or directly through the browser's url bar.

1. Log in to RSC.
1. Open the app tray and select Settings. The Settings menu appears.
1. Click API Playground. The API Playground page appears.
1. Click Open API Playground. API Playground opens in a new browser tab.

Alternatively, The playground can be accessed directly by supplying the url in this format:

```text
https://<INSTANCE>.my.rubrik.com/playground/
```

Copy and paste the below example query into the playground query pane, and click the execute button.

```graphql
{
  slaDomains {
    nodes {
      name
      id
    }
  }
}
```

### Sample output

```json
{
  "data": {
    "slaDomains": {
      "nodes": [
        {
          "name": "Bronze",
          "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002"
        },
        {
          "name": "Gold",
          "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        },
        {
          "name": "Silver",
          "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Building on the query for SLA Domains, it may be desirable to search by name. The following will walk through using the API documentation in the playground to identify arguments that can be specified for a particular query, and how to implement the arguments.

1. Hover the mouse cursor over `slaDomains` in the query.
1. Click on the `slaDomains` link when the tooltip appears.

A side pane will appear with the API documentation for `slaDomains.`

There are 3 sections in the documentation:

- `Type` - The type of object that gets returned.
- `Arguments` - Variables that can be passed into the query, such as filters or sorting preferences.
- `Implementations` - Additional object types that have their own properties

The arguments have types specified next to the name. The `filter` argument is a type of `[GlobalSlaFilterInput!]`

- `[]` The square braces indicate that we can pass in multiple`GlobalSlaFilterInput` objects. This means multiple filter objects can be passed in.
- `!` The exclamation point means "Non-Null." This symbol is used both in arguments and fields that get returned indicating that the field must be supplied.

Click on the `GlobalSlaFilterInput` type in the documentation. The documentation will navigate to the documentation for this type.

To search by name, set the `field` to `NAME`. Clicking on `GlobalSlaQueryFilterInputField` will display the enum values that are available to filter on.

Set `text` to the name of the SLA domain to search for.

Note

Some queries will have their own filtering arguments that are unique to the context of that object. The API documentation for each query will specify the filtering syntax and capabilities for each query.

Arguments are supplied to a query in parenthesis `()` after the query name. Create the filter object as an argument to the `slaDomains` query. Change the `text` content to an SLA domain name in the currently connected RSC instance.

```graphql
{
  slaDomains(filter: {field: NAME text: "bronze"}) {
    nodes {
      name
      id
    }
  }
}
```

The result will be only SLA Domains starting with `bronze`

```json
{
  "data": {
    "slaDomains": {
      "nodes": [
        {
          "name": "Bronze",
          "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

For GraphQL errors, see the [troubleshooting](https://developer.rubrik.com/Rubrik-Security-Cloud-API/troubleshooting/index.md) page.

### 401 JWT is missing.

This error indicates that the user session has expired. Refreshing the page will take you to the RSC login page to reauthenticate.

- Enum value SnapshotQueryFilterField.IS_ARCHIVED was deprecated with reason A snapshot can potentially be uploaded to multiple archival locations. This field does not give the archival status of the snapshot - whether it is uploaded to all the archival locations or partially uploaded to a few locations. Hence, this filter field is deprecated and would be removed subsequently. Please use a combination of ARCHIVAL_LOCATION_IDS and SOURCE_SNAPSHOT_IDS fields instead.
- Enum value SnapshotQueryFilterField.SLA_ID was deprecated with reason There is no concept of SLA ID on a snapshot. SLA is assigned to an object and snapshots are taken based on the configuration of the SLA Domain at that point of time. However, SLA configurations may change at a later point in time, without reflecting the change on the snapshot, if not retroactively assigned. Hence, this filter field is deprecated and would be removed subsequently.

Hence, this filter field is deprecated and would be removed subsequently. Please use a combination of ARCHIVAL_LOCATION_IDS and SOURCE_SNAPSHOT_IDS fields instead.
- **`SLA_ID`**: There is no concept of SLA ID on a snapshot. SLA is assigned to an object and snapshots are taken based on the configuration of the SLA Domain at that point of time. However, SLA configurations may change at a later point in time, without reflecting the change on the snapshot, if not retroactively assigned. Hence, this filter field is deprecated and would be removed subsequently.

#### TargetQueryFilterField

- **`GROUP_NAME`**: We do not use archival groups currently.
- **`IS_ARCHIVED`**: Archived locations should not be queried for.
- **`IS_MANAGED_BY_AUTO_AG`**: We do not use archival groups currently.

In Rubrik, snapshots are a point-in-time copy of data, coupled with metadata. Snapshots can be managed by an SLA Domain, ahearing to the policy's archival, replication, and retention rules. Snapshot's can also be unmanaged, which means they are not tied to a specific policy, and retained forever.

## Retrieving Snapshots for a Workload

When retrieving snapshots for a workload, use that workload's RSC `id`. If using `snappableConnection` to list objects, use the `fid` field from the query. In the case of MSSQL databases, you must use the `dagId` from the MSSQL database object.

```graphql
query {
  snapshotOfASnappableConnection(
    workloadId: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
  ) {

## Placing a Snapshot on Legal Hold

```graphql
mutation {
  createLegalHold(input: {
    snapshotIds: ["123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"]

## Deleting Unmanaged Snapshots

Unmanaged snapshots have no policy and will be retained forever until deleted. A snapshot is an unmanaged or "forever" if `isExpirationDateCalculated` is *true* and `expirationTime` is *null*.

```graphql
mutation {

    snapshotIds: ["124a67b6-be5a-5181-9447-fac686bc9949"]
  }) {
    success
  }
}
```

```powershell
$query = New-RscMutation -GqlMutation deleteUnmanagedSnapshots
$query.var.input = Get-RscType -Name DeleteUnmanagedSnapshotsInput
$query.var.input.SnapshotIds = @("124a67b6-be5a-5181-9447-fac686bc9949")
$query.Invoke()
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# RSC_TOKEN="YOUR_RSC_ACCESS_TOKEN"

## Service Accounts (OAuth2 Client Credentials Grant)

A service account represents an application that needs authentication and authorization to invoke Rubrik APIs, as opposed to a user account that represents an individual user. A client ID and client secret are used to authenticate to an authorization server and obtain an access token to invoke the Rubrik APIs. Similar to user accounts, Rubrik allows assigning roles to the service accounts to enable role-based access control. But contrary to user accounts, service accounts cannot be used to access the Rubrik web UI.

### Security

Service accounts enable client applications and other services to invoke the Rubrik APIs securely. When creating a service account, the authorization server assigns a unique client ID and client secret to the account. The combination of client ID and client secret is known as client credentials. The client credentials are known only to the client that is represented by the service account and the authorization server that grants the credentials to the service account. The client application authenticates to the authorization server using the client credentials and obtains an access token to authenticate to the Rubrik API server and access the protected resources.

### Guidelines

Consider the following best practices when using service accounts:

- One service account should represent only one client application.
- The role assigned to the service account should be the one with least number of privileges that would be sufficient for the client application being represented by the service account to access the Rubrik APIs.
- The client credentials must be saved when they are first created as Rubrik does not provide an option to display them again.
- The client secret must be treated like a password and stored in a secure location.
- Service account access tokens should be cached and reused until they are valid.

### Usage

#### Obtaining an access token

In this example, the service account client ID and secret are exported into environment variables and posted to the RSC client_token endpoint. The response contains the access token needed for authenticated API calls. The `jq` tool is used to parse the access token from the JSON response and stored in a variable for usage.

```bash
export RSC_FQDN="example.my.rubrik.com"
export RSC_CLIENT_ID="client|c9bba9a9-1234-1234-b7c6-123440b4cf64"
export RSC_CLIENT_SECRET="ExampleServiceAccountSecret"

RSC_TOKEN=$(curl --silent --location "https://$RSC_FQDN/api/client_token" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  --data "client_id=$RSC_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=$RSC_CLIENT_SECRET&grant_type=client_credentials" | jq -r '.access_token')

export RSC_TOKEN
```

An example response from the authorization server shows the access token and the number of seconds when the token will expire. This time is configurable up to 24 hours within the RSC session security settings.

```json
{"client_id":"client|c9bba9a9-1234-1234-b7c6-123440b4cf64","access_token":"eyJ...","expires_in":43200}
```

#### Using the access token

The access token is used as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header of all subsequent API calls.

```bash
curl --location "https://$RSC_FQDN/api/graphql" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $RSC_TOKEN" \
--data '{"query":"query slaDomains {nodes {name id}}}","variables":{}}'
```

#### Deleting a session

While there is no restriction on the number of active sessions a service account can have, Rubrik provides an API endpoint to delete an existing session.

Run the following command to revoke the session established for the service account. Successful revocation will result in an HTTP status code of `204`.

```bash
curl -X DELETE --location "https://$RSC_FQDN/api/session" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $RSC_TOKEN"
```

### Service Account Management

## User Accounts (OAuth2 Authorization Code with PKCE)

Note

This OAuth2 flow is only supported for Annapurna retrievers.

OAuth2 Authorization Code with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is a more secure OAuth2 flow, primarily used by mobile and native applications but can also be applied in web applications. It ensures that an authentication code, specifically a hashed code verifier (called a code challenge), is presented to an authorization server along with the authorization code.

### Security

This OAuth2 flow requires a two-step exchange to obtain an access token. First, the client application requests an authorization code from an authorization server, specifying the code challenge and the method used to generate it. The authorization server responds with an authorization code, which is later exchanged, along with the original code verifier, for an access token. This process mitigates the risk of authorization codes being intercepted by attackers.

### Guidelines

Consider the following best practices when using OAuth2 Authorization Code with PKCE:

- Ensure the client securely generates a sufficiently random code verifier for every authorization request.
- The code verifier must be securely stored in the client for retrieval during the token exchange step.
- The code challenge method supported by Rubrik APIs is `S256` (SHA-256).
- Tokens must be securely stored and handled to avoid unauthorized access.

### Usage

#### OAuth Application Registration

OAuth2 Authorization Code grants requires registration of the OAuth application in Rubrik Security Cloud. During registration, a client ID and secret will be generated for the application, and will be used in the authorization request.

#### Initiating Authorization Request

To initiate an authorization request, the client application generates a random code verifier and a code challenge (SHA-256 hash of the code verifier). The authorization URL is constructed with necessary parameters, including the client ID, response type, redirect URI, and code challenge method.

The following python example results in an access token printed to the screen by a locally running HTTP service. It can be stored in a python file (e.g. rsc_oauth_example.py) and executed using python (e.g. `python rsc_oauth_example.py`). Modify the configuration items in the script as needed.

```python

Note

The response code of the HTTP request will be 200, and the body of the response will contain the HTTP error code.

Note

It can extremely difficult to troubleshoot code logic without much context. If additional help from the Rubrik support team is required, limit the code shared to only the offending query or SDK method. Include literal variable values to verify what is being passed in to the query or SDK method.

## Error code **400**

______________________________________________________________________

### Reason

These occur when the query is incorrect according to the schema.

### Solution

Verify the query and variables supplied to the query are in accordance with the schema. This can be done with any tool that can validate the query against the schema. The RSC API playground is the easiest way to accomplish this.

Example Erroneous Query

```graphql
query {
  slaDomains {
    nodes {
      name
      id
      description
    }
  }
}
```

Example Error Response

```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "uri": "/api/graphql",
  "traceSpan": {
    "traceId": "yQq0Pl2VftOESD4kCtiFdg==",
    "operation": "/api/graphql",
    "spanId": "hEMkvglH1gc="
  },
  "message": "[QueryAnalysisError] [DLC Team] Encountered Client error (400) executing query with operations: [] and variables {}. Error: Query does not pass validation. Violations:\n\nCannot query field 'description' on type 'SlaDomain'. Did you mean to use an inline fragment on 'GlobalSlaReply'? (line 6, column 7):\n      description\n      ^"
}
```

The error message states the query doesn't pass validation, and describes the violations saying it cannot query the field `description`. Many times, the API will give suggestions as to what can be done to correct the query such as "Did you mean to use an inline fragment on 'GlobalSlaReply'?" This indicates the field `description` is actually located on an 'implementation' of the `SlaDomain` type.

### Corrected Query

```graphql
query {
  slaDomains {
    nodes {
      name
      id
      ... on GlobalSlaReply {
        description
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Code **403**

### Reason

These errors are the result of a permissions issue. While RBAC is a common cause, the other reason could be that the query, or even a field in the query is behind a feature flag that is not enabled. This occurs when a development feature is deployed into the production API schema behind a feature flag, or the query is a part of licensing that has not been purchased or approved.

### Solution

Remove the field, find an alternative query, or be sure that the permissions applied to the service account are sufficient to perform this query.

### Example Erroneous Query

```graphql
query {
  clusterConnection(filter: {name: "example"}) {
    nodes {
      name
      isTprEnabled
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "clusterConnection": {
      "nodes": [
        {
          "name": "example",
          "isTprEnabled": null
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Account does not have the appropriate features enabled to access the field.",
      "path": [
        "clusterConnection",
        "nodes",
        0,
        "isTprEnabled"
      ],
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 5,
          "column": 7
        }
      ],
      "extensions": {
        "code": 403,
        "trace": {
          "operation": "/api/graphql",
          "traceId": "9v0wj/Sm9UVOdUFd1ottJQ==",
          "spanId": "Jygbg58zl/M="
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Corrected Query

```graphql
query {
  clusterConnection(filter: {name: "example"}) {
    nodes {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The offending field mentioned in the error has been removed.

## Error Code **404**

### Reason

These errors indicate you've provided an ID that does not exist for an object using the supplied query.

### Solution

Identify the correct ID or query to be used.

### Example Erroneous Query

```graphql
query {
  vSphereVmNew(fid: "7d303326-7c2c-4ea2-b463-dedb8910d98a") {
    name
    id
  }
}
```

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "NOT_FOUND: Unable to find managed object for ID or you are not authorized to access it",
      "path": [
        "vSphereVmNew"
      ],
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 2,
          "column": 3
        }
      ],
      "extensions": {
        "code": 404,
        "trace": {
          "operation": "/api/graphql",
          "traceId": "gwzt2HR5GinN4PrhQfJ+Bg==",
          "spanId": "/MR1LoaAiD8="
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Code **500**

### Reason

These errors are server-side, and a defect should be filed immediately. It could be that the query is not being used as intended, but the API should catch this. This error indicates that the API let the call through to the back-end service and the service is responding with an error. Essentially this is an “uncaught exception.

### Solution

File an engineering case with the product team that owns this query. If possible, use a different query.

### Example Erroneous Query

```graphql
mutation {
  takeOnDemandSnapshot(input: {workloadIds: "fef3f155-7092-5b19-bcea-fe8021c38dc6" slaId: "c2c3823f-d74d-49a1-afbe-8d7e0a4d3b7c"}) {
    taskchainUuids {
      taskchainUuid
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "The on-demand snapshot is not supported for given workload type: Mssql",
      "path": [
        "takeOnDemandSnapshot"
      ],
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 2,
          "column": 3
        }
      ],
      "extensions": {
        "code": 500,
        "trace": {
          "operation": "/api/graphql",
          "traceId": "7hcbDGDPt7EqAkBQ1vSu/A==",
          "spanId": "HrzcWppCISg="
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Corrected Query

```graphql
mutation {
 createOnDemandMssqlBackup(
  input: {
    id: "fef3f155-7092-5b19-bcea-fe8021c38dc6" 
    config:{
      baseOnDemandSnapshotConfig: {
        slaId: "c2c3823f-d74d-49a1-afbe-8d7e0a4d3b7c"
      }
    }
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

The query was updated to utilize the correct mutation for performing an on-demand snapshot of an MSSQL server.

## What is Rubrik Annapurna?

Rubrik Annapurna turns snapshot data into a secure, central library of knowledge for AI applications.

- **No Expensive Data Lake Required**

  ______________________________________________________________________

  Rubrik provides a centralized place to create retrievers for a multitude of data sources. This greatly simplifies the process by having a single API and retriever for heterogeneus data.

- **Built-in Data Security Policies**

  ______________________________________________________________________

  Policies applied to a retriever can eliminate the accidental leakage of sensitive data to LLMs. This protects against sensitive data leakage to Large Language Models(LLMs).

- **Pass-Through File Permissions**

  ______________________________________________________________________

  Permissions set on the source file are respected by the retriever. Only users that have access to the file in production will have access from the retriever.

- **Application-Aware Embedding**

  ______________________________________________________________________

  Leverage intelligent embeddings tailored for third-party or custom app data schemas to enhance compatibility, performance, and time to value.

______________________________________________________________________

## How Annapurna works

Rubrik Annapurna retrievers or "Chatbots" are created from protected object data within Rubrik.

Sensitive data policies can also be defined for the retriever, blocking access to any data containing data such as social security or credit card numbers.

The retriever itself is a vector database with an API, resulting in a data source for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

Large Language Models (LLMs) can use the retrieved data to provide a contextually accurate, human readable response, free of any sensitive data according to the policy, to any question related to the data in the retriever.

```

    end
    data --> vector
    Security --> vector

  end
  A[User submits query] --> B --> C[Relevant Documents] --> D[Language Model] --> E[Generate Final Answer]
```

In this end-to-end example, [LangChain](https://langchain.com) is used to query a Rubrik Annapurna retriever and pass the relevant documents to Azure OpenAI to provide a relevant response.

## Setup Instructions

______________________________________________________________________

______________________________________________________________________

## Rubrik Retriever Class

Save the below code in a file called `rubrik_retriever.py`. This is the Rubrik LangChain `BaseRetriever` which will fetch documents from the retriever through the Rubrik API.

rubrik_retriever.py

```python
import os
import requests
import json
from typing import List
from langchain.schema import Document
from langchain.schema.retriever import BaseRetriever

class RubrikRetriever(BaseRetriever):
    """Custom LangChain retriever for querying the Rubrik vector database via REST API."""

    retriever_id: str  # This is the retriever or "Chatbot" ID from Rubrik.
    rsc_fqdn: str = os.getenv("RSC_FQDN")  # This is your RSC instance e.g. example.my.rubrik.com
    rsc_token: str = os.getenv("RSC_TOKEN")  # RSC API Token

    def _get_relevant_documents(self, query: str) -> List[Document]:
        """Sends a query to the API and retrieves relevant chunks."""

        headers = {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.rsc_token}"
        }
        api_url = f"https://{self.rsc_fqdn}/api/annapurna/{self.retriever_id}/retrieve"

        payload = {"query": query}
        response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)

        if response.status_code != 200:
            raise Exception(f"Error from API: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")

        results = response.json().get("results", [])

        return [
            Document(page_content=result["content"], metadata={"source_url": result["sourceUrl"]})
            for result in results
        ]
```

______________________________________________________________________

## Langchain with Rubrik and Azure OpenAI

Save the below code in a file called `annapurna_query.py`. This performs the chain to query the Rubrik retriever, pass the results to Azure OpenAI, and print the response.

annapurna_query.py

```python
import argparse
import os
from rubrik_retriever import RubrikRetriever  # Import the retriever class
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI

# Set up argument parsing
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Run a query using RubrikRetriever and Azure OpenAI GPT-4o.")
parser.add_argument("retriever_id", type=str, help="The retriever ID for RubrikRetriever.")
parser.add_argument("query", type=str, help="The query to be processed by the retriever and LLM.")
args = parser.parse_args()

# Initialize the retriever with the retriever ID
retriever = RubrikRetriever(retriever_id=args.retriever_id)

# Initialize the Azure OpenAI GPT-4o model
llm = AzureChatOpenAI(
    openai_api_version="2024-02-15-preview",
    azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
    openai_api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    deployment_name=os.getenv("AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"),
    model=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL", "gpt-4o"),
)

# Define a custom prompt
custom_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="""You are a helpful assistant. Use the following retrieved documents to answer the question:

    Retrieved Documents:
    {context}

    Question: {question}

    Answer:""",
    input_variables=["question", "context"],
)

# Create the RAG pipeline using LangChain's RetrievalQA
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=retriever,
    chain_type="stuff",
    return_source_documents=False,  # Only return the LLM response
    chain_type_kwargs={"prompt": custom_prompt},
)

# Retrieve the LLM response
response = qa_chain.invoke({"query": args.query})

# Extract and print only the LLM-generated response. For full response, change the below to print(response)
if isinstance(response, dict) and "result" in response:
    print(response["result"])  # Correct way to access the response
else:
    print("⚠️ Unexpected response format:", response)  # Debugging fallback
```

______________________________________________________________________

### Usage

Run `annapurna_query.py` by providing the Rubrik retriever ID and a query relevant to the data contained in the Rubrik retriever.

```shell
python annapurna_query.py <retriever_id> "Your query here"
```

## Listing Retrievers

Performing a query against a retriever requires a retriever ID. To list retrievers, perform the following API call against the Rubrik Security Cloud API.

```graphql
query {
    chatbots {
        nodes {
            name
            id
        }
    }
}
```

```python
import requests
import json
import os

# Get RSC access token from environment variable
RSC_TOKEN = os.getenv("RSC_TOKEN")

# Define the GraphQL query
query = {
    "query": "query { chatbots(nameSearchFilter: \"exampleRetriever\") { nodes { name id } } }"
}

# Set headers
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {RSC_TOKEN}"
}

# Define the GraphQL API endpoint
url = "https://example.my.rubrik.com/api/graphql"

# Execute the GraphQL query
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(query))

# Print the response
print(response.json())
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# RSC_TOKEN="YOUR_RSC_ACCESS_TOKEN"
query="query { chatbots { nodes { name id } } }"

# Execute the GraphQL query with curl
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RSC_TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"query\": \"$query\"}" \
  https://example.my.rubrik.com/api/graphql
```

### API Endpoint: `POST /api/annapurna/{id}/retrieve`

The Data Protection App provides the core tools and features for protecting, managing, and analyzing your data.

## [SLA Domains](https://developer.rubrik.com/Rubrik-Security-Cloud-API/Data-Protection/SLA-Domains/index.md)

SLA Domains provide the governance for how an object should be protected, defining frequency, retention, archival, and replication policies. Instead of complicated backup schedules and sequencing, SLA Domains provide an intelligent framework to define business requirements for protection.

## [Infrastructure](https://developer.rubrik.com/Rubrik-Security-Cloud-API/Data-Protection/Infrastructure/index.md)

Infrastructure refers to the physical or virtual machines that run the Rubrik software. Infrastructure can include Rubrik Clusters and Rubrik Cloud Vault.

## [Data Center](https://developer.rubrik.com/Rubrik-Security-Cloud-API/Data-Protection/Data-Center/index.md)

Data Center protection is categorized as anything protected by a Rubrik cluster. This can include cloud workloads protected by a Rubrik Cloud Cluster.

## [Cloud](https://developer.rubrik.com/Rubrik-Security-Cloud-API/Data-Protection/Cloud/index.md)

Cloud protection is categorized as anything protected by Rubrik Cloud-Native protection.

## What are SLA Domains?

Rubrik SLA Domains are data protection policies that define:

- The **object types** for which the policy can be applied
- The **frequency** of the backups
- The **retention** of the backups
- The **replication** destination of the backups
- The **archival** location of the backups
- **Object specific settings** based on the type (e.g. MSSQL Database)

## Retrieve All SLAs

```graphql
query {
  slaDomains {
    nodes {

## Retrieve an SLA by Name

Generally, the name of the SLA may be known, but not the ID. The `slaDomains` query allows filtering on several fields, including `NAME`.

## Creating an SLA Domain

SLA domains can range from simple to very complex policy definitions.

```graphql
mutation createSla {
  createGlobalSla(input: {
    name: "foo"
    objectTypes: [VSPHERE_OBJECT_TYPE MSSQL_OBJECT_TYPE]
    snapshotSchedule: {
      daily: {
        basicSchedule: {
          frequency: 1
          retention: 7
          retentionUnit: DAYS
        }
      }
    }
  }) {
    name
    id
  }
}
```

```powershell
$dailySchedule = New-RscSlaSnapshotSchedule -Type daily -Frequency 1 -Retention 2 -RetentionUnit DAYS
New-RscSla -name "foo" -DailySchedule $dailySchedule -ObjectType VSPHERE_OBJECT_TYPE,MSSQL_OBJECT_TYPE
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# RSC_TOKEN="YOUR_RSC_ACCESS_TOKEN"
query="mutation createSla { createGlobalSla(input: { name: \\\"foo\\\" objectTypes: [VSPHERE_OBJECT_TYPE MSSQL_OBJECT_TYPE] snapshotSchedule: { daily: { basicSchedule: { frequency: 1 retention: 7 retentionUnit: DAYS } } } }) { name id } }"

# Execute the GraphQL query with curl
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RSC_TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"query\": \"$query\"}" \
  https://example.my.rubrik.com/api/graphql
```

## Modifying an SLA Domain

Modification of an SLA requires the entire SLA object to be passed in to the mutation. If every property is not passed in, the SLA update will either fail, or will be updated with only the portions of the object that were passed in to the update arguments.

```graphql
mutation createSla {
  updateGlobalSla(input: {
    id: "2794261b-0e3b-4eab-8a32-f1ce4579e8c7"
    name: "foo"
    objectTypes: [VSPHERE_OBJECT_TYPE MSSQL_OBJECT_TYPE]
    description: "This is my foo SLA Domain"
    snapshotSchedule: {
      daily: {
        basicSchedule: {
          frequency: 1
          retention: 7
          retentionUnit: DAYS
        }
      }
    }
  }) {
    name
    id
  }
}
```

```powershell
$sla = Get-RscSla "foo"
$sla | Set-RscSla -Description "This is my foo SLA"
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# RSC_TOKEN="YOUR_RSC_ACCESS_TOKEN"
query="mutation createSla { updateGlobalSla(input: { id: \\\"2794261b-0e3b-4eab-8a32-f1ce4579e8c7\\\" name: \\\"foo\\\" objectTypes: [VSPHERE_OBJECT_TYPE MSSQL_OBJECT_TYPE] description: \\\"This is my foo SLA Domain\\\" snapshotSchedule: { daily: { basicSchedule: { frequency: 1 retention: 7 retentionUnit: DAYS } } } }) { name id } }"

# Execute the GraphQL query with curl
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RSC_TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"query\": \"$query\"}" \
  https://example.my.rubrik.com/api/graphql
```

## Job Status

Tasks such as on-demand backups and recoveries are asynchronous requests and return an AsynRequestStatus which can be monitored for progress and completion.

To monitor the asynchronous request status for VMware vSphere, provide the ID of the cluster and the ID of the job. You can query the request status periodically until a terminal state (`SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, `CANCELLED`) is set given in the status field.

```graphql

### Job Status

Tasks such as on-demand backups and recoveries are asynchronous requests and return an AsynRequestStatus which can be monitored for progress and completion.

To monitor the asynchronous request status for VMware vSphere, provide the ID of the cluster and the ID of the job. You can query the request status periodically until a terminal state (`SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, `CANCELLED`) is set given in the status field.

```graphql
query {
  db2DatabaseJobStatus(input: {
    id: "CREATE_DB2_FULL_SNAPSHOT_809663d4-b82a-485e-a7ba-cf7cf88e9fdf_966044a8-89a8-441c-90ca-d360279543df:::0"
    clusterUuid: "85e98e61-4c1f-496a-b846-5eb871966025"
  }) {
    progress
    status
    result
    error {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

```powershell

## Managed Volumes

Managed volumes become writable when a snapshot operation begins. During this time, data can be written as needed. Once all writes are complete, the on-demand backup process must be ended upon completion of writes.

### Job Status

Tasks such as on-demand backups and recoveries are asynchronous requests and return an AsynRequestStatus which can be monitored for progress and completion.

To monitor the asynchronous request status for VMware vSphere, provide the ID of the cluster and the ID of the job. You can query the request status periodically until a terminal state (`SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, `CANCELLED`) is set given in the status field.

```graphql
query {
  vSphereVMAsyncRequestStatus(
    id: "d4822e3d-c6e3-4bbe-950e-3e63c4770a78"
    clusterUuid: "e4e7d2a2-c58b-4bc2-b11e-d6f9102e6fc8"
  ) {
    id
    status
    startTime
    progress
    endTime
    error {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

```powershell
$query = New-RscQuery -GqlQuery vSphereVMAsyncRequestStatus
$query.var.id = $request.Id
$query.var.clusterUuid = $vm.cluster.Id
$query.invoke()

## [Events](https://developer.rubrik.com/Rubrik-Security-Cloud-API/Observability/Events/index.md)

Events are state changes within Rubrik. Events can be as simple as a successful backup, or as serious as a ransomware anomaly detected within data protected by Rubrik. Events can be obtained through an API query, or streamed to an external system via webhooks.

## [Metrics](https://developer.rubrik.com/Rubrik-Security-Cloud-API/Observability/Metrics/index.md)

Various metrics can be obtained on the Rubrik platform for capacity management, chargeback, compliance status, and more.

## [Reports](https://developer.rubrik.com/Rubrik-Security-Cloud-API/Observability/Reports/index.md)

Rubrik's reporting engine simplifies reporting process by creating CSV or PDF reports for the most common requirements. Reports can be customized through the Rubrik Security Cloud console and automated generation and download can be completed through the API.

A common requirement for Rubrik customers is the ability to retrieve metrics for reporting and monitoring. This can include storage usage for chargeback and capacity management, compliance status, SLA assignment, and more. The Rubrik Security Cloud API provides a powerful way to query for these metrics.

## Workload Metrics

Common workload metrics can include storage usage, compliance status, last backup time, protection status, and more. Filtering based on object type, SLA, Organization, and other criteria provides the ability to create reports tailored to specific needs.

```graphql
query {
  snappableConnection(filter: {
    #complianceStatus: IN_COMPLIANCE
    #slaTimeRange: LAST_24_HOURS
    #objectType: VmwareVirtualMachine
    #objectState: ACTIVE
    #slaDomain: {id: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"}
    #protectionStatus: DoNotProtect
    #orgId: "12345678-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  }) {
    nodes {
      name
      fid
      location
      objectType
      objectState
      protectionStatus
      lastSnapshot
      latestReplicationSnapshot
      complianceStatus
      replicationComplianceStatus
      archivalComplianceStatus
      usedBytes
      localStorage
      localEffectiveStorage
      replicaStorage
      archiveStorage
      logicalBytes
      physicalBytes
      provisionedBytes
      totalSnapshots
      localSnapshots
      localOnDemandSnapshots
      localSlaSnapshots
      replicaSnapshots
      archiveSnapshots
      dataReduction
      slaDomain {
        name
        id
      }
      cluster {
        name
        id
      }
      workloadOrg {
        fullName
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```powershell
Get-RscWorkload
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# RSC_TOKEN="YOUR_RSC_ACCESS_TOKEN"
query="query { snappableConnection(filter: { }) { nodes { name fid location objectType objectState protectionStatus lastSnapshot latestReplicationSnapshot complianceStatus replicationComplianceStatus archivalComplianceStatus usedBytes localStorage localEffectiveStorage replicaStorage archiveStorage logicalBytes physicalBytes provisionedBytes totalSnapshots localSnapshots localOnDemandSnapshots localSlaSnapshots replicaSnapshots archiveSnapshots dataReduction slaDomain { name id } cluster { name id } workloadOrg { fullName id } } } }"

# Execute the GraphQL query with curl
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RSC_TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"query\": \"$query\"}" \
  https://example.my.rubrik.com/api/graphql
```

The reporting system in Rubrik Security Cloud provides an interface to build reports based on a number of templates, and a scheduler to build and deliver the reports via email. Reports can also be built and downloaded via the API.

## List Reports

To determine the ID for a given report, you can use the `allCustomReports` query. This ID is used in the `downloadReportCsvAsync` mutation to generate the report.

```graphql
query {
  allCustomReports(input: {}) {
    name
    id
  }
}
```

```powershell

```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# RSC_TOKEN="YOUR_RSC_ACCESS_TOKEN"
query="query { allCustomReports(input: {}) { name id } }"

# Execute the GraphQL query with curl
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RSC_TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"query\": \"$query\"}" \
  https://example.my.rubrik.com/api/graphql
```

## Generate Report CSV

The `downloadReportCsvAsync` mutation will generate a report and return an `externalId` that can be used to download the report. The report is generated asynchronously, and the `externalId` can be used to monitor the status of the report generation.

```graphql
mutation {
  downloadReportCsvAsync(input: {id: <REPORT ID>}) {
    jobId
    referenceId
    externalId
  }
}
```

```powershell

```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# RSC_TOKEN="YOUR_RSC_ACCESS_TOKEN"
query="mutation { downloadReportCsvAsync(input: {id: <REPORT ID>}) { jobId referenceId externalId } }"

# Execute the GraphQL query with curl
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RSC_TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"query\": \"$query\"}" \
  https://example.my.rubrik.com/api/graphql
```

## Monitor Report Generation Status

The `allUserFiles` query will return a list of all files that have been generated. The `externalId` can be used to monitor the status of the report generation.

```graphql
query {
  allUserFiles {
    downloads {
      externalId
      createdAt
      expiresAt
      completedAt
      creator
      filename
      type
      state
    }
  }
}
```

```powershell

```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# RSC_TOKEN="YOUR_RSC_ACCESS_TOKEN"
query="query { allUserFiles { downloads { externalId createdAt expiresAt completedAt creator filename type state } } }"

# Execute the GraphQL query with curl
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RSC_TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"query\": \"$query\"}" \
  https://example.my.rubrik.com/api/graphql
```

## Download Report

The CSV file will be downloadable from RSC from the file downloads URL in the format below. Replace `<instance>` with the FQDN of the RSC instance and `<externalId>` with the `externalId` returned from the `downloadReportCsvAsync` mutation.

```text
https://<instance>.my.rubrik.com/file-downloads/<externalId>
```

Note

The CSV is only downloadable by the service account that generated the report.

## Retrieving Events via API

Rubrik events can be retrieved via API query for use in automation or reporting. Rubrik stores 90 days of events in Rubrik Security Cloud. If retention requirements are greater than 90 days, events can be pulled via API or pushed via webhooks to an external system. When querying for events, it's best to limit the time range and query as frequently as needed. Depending on the size of the environment, the queries can result in a very long running query due to the volume of events.

### Workload Events

```graphql
query {
  activitySeriesConnection(filters: {
    #lastUpdatedTimeGt: "2025-02-22T00:00:00Z"
    #orgIds: ["288970b2-16a0-4c65-a5fa-b0c86f5af337"]

## Pushing Events Using Webhooks

Webhooks provide a mechanism to push events via HTTP to an external system. Webhooks contain a JSON payload with details about the event. The default payload format is PagerDuty Common Event Format (PD-CEF). Custom JSON templates can also be created to meet the requirements of external systems that have specific payload requirements.

The webhook retry/backoff policy is as follows:

| Retry Count | Backoff Time |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 1           | 1 second     |
| 2           | 5 seconds    |
| 3           | 10 seconds   |

After 3 attempts, the event will be removed from the queue. The webhook will be auto-disabled if there are 25 consecutive failures.

### Webhooks Overview Video

### Default Webhook Payload Format

The following is an example webhook of a Rubrik event in the default format. For more detailed information on Rubrik webhooks, see the [RSC User Guide](https://docs.rubrik.com/en-us/saas/saas/common/webhooks.html)

default webhook payload example

### Building a Custom Webhook Payload Template

Custom Webhook templates are freeform JSON documents that can contain any variables that are available in the webhook payload. External systems may have specific payload requirements that require a custom template. Click the annotation icons in the code below for various ways to customize the webhook payload.

custom webhook template example

```json
{
    "customTitle": "{{.ActivityType}} - {{.Status}}", //(1)!
    "message": "{{.Message}}",
    "severity": "1", //(2!
    "timestamp": "{{.Time.UTC.Format \"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z\"}}", //(3)!
    "class": "{{.Class}}",
    "aggregationKey": "{{.ActivitySeriesID}}",
    "id": "{{.UUID}}",

### Pre-Built Webhook Templates

#### Datadog Webhook Template Example

Datadog requires a specific payload format to [post an event](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/events/#post-an-event). The following is an example webhook template that can be used to send events to Datadog. Authentication is required to send events to Datadog. In the Rubrik webhook configuration, choose custom, input `DD-API-KEY` as the header key, and provide the [Datadog API key](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/#api-keys) as the header value. Customize the payload as needed for the events being sent.

Rubrik Threat Analytics provides services to discover and identify malware, anomalies and other potential Indicators of Compromise (IOC). Identifying threats within protected data speeds up cyber recovery by identifying restore points that are free from common malware file signatures and content that is specified via YARA rule.

## [Anomaly Detection](https://developer.rubrik.com/Rubrik-Security-Cloud-API/Threat-Analytics/Anomaly-Detection/index.md)

Anomaly Detection automatically scans snapshots for suspicious data changes based on previous snapshots. Anomaly Detection is passive and does not require any user intervention to run.

## [Threat Hunting](https://developer.rubrik.com/Rubrik-Security-Cloud-API/Threat-Analytics/Threat-Hunting/index.md)

Threat Hunting provides advanced investigation of snaphots for specific file hashes, file patterns, and YARA rules provided by the user. Threat Hunts are defined and initiated by the user.

## [Threat Monitoring](https://developer.rubrik.com/Rubrik-Security-Cloud-API/Threat-Analytics/Threat-Monitoring/index.md)

Threat Monitoring automatically scans each snapshot for file hashes that have a match in a threat feed. When enabled, Threat Monitoring is passive and does not require any user intervention to run.

The Rubrik Security Cloud PowerShell module extends your PowerShell console to give you full access to the Rubrik Security Cloud API.

- **Easy to use cmdlets** provide maximum efficiency to perform tasks.
- **Advanced cmdlets** facilitate advanced access to the Rubrik Security Cloud API, opening up the entire RSC API toautomation through PowerShell.
- **Integrated Help** is provided for each cmdlet, and even the API schema.
- **Rubrik supported.** Customer support is available for help on individual commands, but not script logic.

### Prerequisites

______________________________________________________________________

- PowerShell Recommended Version: `7.x`
- Rubrik Security Cloud Service Account

Note

On **Windows** machines, The [execution policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies) in PowerShell must be `RemoteSigned` or less stringent. Rubrik does not recommend bypassing or unrestricting the execution policy.

```PowerShell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

## Installation

______________________________________________________________________

Rubrik utilizes the [Microsoft PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/rubriksecuritycloud) for package installation. To install from the PowerShell Gallery, use the `Install-Module` cmdlet.

```PowerShell
Install-Module RubrikSecurityCloud -Scope CurrentUser
```

To verify installation, use the `Get-Module` cmdlet.

```PowerShell
Get-Module -ListAvailable RubrikSecurityCloud
```

```text
# Example Output
    Directory: /Users/Joe.Smith/.local/share/powershell/Modules

ModuleType Version    PreRelease Name                                PSEdition ExportedCommands
---------- -------    ---------- ----                                --------- ----------------
Script     1.12.3                RubrikSecurityCloud                 Desk
```

PowerShell should auto-import the module upon use of any cmdlet in the module, but it can also be forced using the `Import-Module` cmdlet if issues arise.

```PowerShell
Import-Module RubrikSecurityCloud
```

## Connecting to RSC

______________________________________________________________________

The RSC PowerShell Module utilizes RSC Service Accounts for authentication. Create a Service Account and download the JSON file.

The Service Account JSON file contains unencrypted credentials. The `Set-RscServiceAccountFile` will created an encrypted credentials file and offer to automatically remove the JSON file from disk.

```text
Set-RscServiceAccountFile -InputFilePath /path/to/service_account.json
```

Connect to RSC using the `Connect-Rsc` cmdlet. The RSC instance and credentials are automatically retrieved from the encrypted credentials XML.

```text
Connect-Rsc
```

## Getting Help

______________________________________________________________________

To begin running commands, start by listing the commands that are available in the module using the `Get-Command` cmdlet.

```PowerShell
Get-Command -Module RubrikSecurityCloud -CommandType Function
```

To get help on an individual cmdlet, use the `Get-Help` cmdlet.

```PowerShell
Get-Help Get-RscSla -Full
```

## Updating

______________________________________________________________________

To update to the latest version of the RSC PowerShell module, use the `Update-Module` cmdlet. Restart the PowerShell terminal session or use `Remove-Module RubrikSecurityCloud` to unload the old version from memory. Import the new module version using `Import-Module RubrikSecurityCloud`.

```PowerShell
Update-Module RubrikSecurityCloud -Scope CurrentUser
```

Note

PowerShell allows multiple versions of PowerShell modules to be installed, and does not uninstall older versions of modules. This is for script compatibility in the event a module has a breaking change. To uninstall previous versions, you must use the `Uninstall-Module` cmdlet and specify the versions you want to uninstall.

```PowerShell
Uninstall-Module RubrikSecurityCloud -RequiredVersion 1.11.2 -Force
```

The goal at Rubrik is to have a cmdlet for every useful task that needs to be performed. As we strive toward this goal, there may be times where an easy-to-use cmdlet is not available. This may also be the case for new features, or edge cases that are not yet supported by the cmdlets. For this reason, it may be necessary to interact with the Rubrik Security Cloud API at a lower level.

At its heart, The Rubrik Security Cloud PowerShell library is a collection of .NET libraries to provide full access to the API without writing any GraphQL queries. While writing GraphQL directly is not required, it is necessary to understand and utilize the API documentation since they are still GraphQL queries written in .NET/PowerShell.

## 'Low-level' cmdlets

______________________________________________________________________

The following cmdlets are essential to working with the RSC API through the PowerShell module.

- `New-RscQuery`,`New-RscMutation` queries are split into two categories: Queries(read) and Mutations(writes). These cmdlets will create a query object for either a query or a mutation respectively. Interestingly, queries and mutations are both considered "queries" so the word "query" will be used generically for either throughout the documentation.
- `Invoke-Rsc` performs the provided query object against the RSC API. It returns the full HTTP response, including the data provided by the query, converted to .NET/PowerShell objects.
- `Get-RscHelp` can be used to get information about queries, their inputs, and the object types they return. This is a lightweight version of the API reference, but not a complete substitute.
- `Get-RscType` instantiates an object of a specific type within RSC. GraphQL is a strongly typed architecture, which means everything has a type and there is no guessing on the structure. This is especially beneficial when working with large, complex objects. The .NET libraries take the types from the GraphQL API and create .NET equivilents.

## Constructing PowerShell code from a GraphQL query

______________________________________________________________________

The following GraphQL example is a simple query to identify all objects in the Gold SLA that are out of compliance in the last 24 hours. The goal will be to convert this to PowerShell.

```GraphQL
query example {
  snappableConnection (filter: {
    slaDomain: {id: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"}
    slaTimeRange: LAST_24_HOURS
    complianceStatus: OUT_OF_COMPLIANCE
  }
  ) {
    nodes {
      name
      id
      location
      objectType
      slaDomain {
        name
      }
      missedSnapshots
    }
  }
}
```

### Creating the Query Object

Create a query object using `New-RscQuery` and select the fields to retrieve using `-AddField`. Note: Use `-FieldProfile EMPTY` to deselect any fields that are automatically selected.

```PowerShell
$query = new-RscQuery -GqlQuery snappableConnection -FieldProfile EMPTY -AddField `
    Nodes.Name `
    Nodes.Id `
    Nodes.Location `
    Nodes.ObjectType `
    Nodes.SlaDomain.Id `
    Nodes.MissedSnapshots
```

`$query` is an `RscQuery` object containing variables to pass in, and fields to retrieve. Using the PowerShell `Get-Member` cmdlet, the type, properties, and methods of the query object are displayed.

```PowerShell
$query | Get-Member

   TypeName: RubrikSecurityCloud.RscQuery

Name           MemberType Definition
----           ---------- ----------
AllFields      Method     System.Collections.Generic.List[string] AllFields(int maxDepth = 0)
Equals         Method     bool Equals(System.Object obj)
Example        Method     string Example()
GetHashCode    Method     int GetHashCode()
GetType        Method     type GetType()
GqlOperation   Method     RubrikSecurityCloud.RscGqlOperation GqlOperation()
GqlRequest     Method     RubrikSecurityCloud.RscGqlRequest GqlRequest(bool verifyQuery = True)
Info           Method     System.Collections.Generic.List[RubrikSecurityCloud.VarInfo] Info()
Invoke         Method     System.Object Invoke()
OpInfo         Method     RubrikSecurityCloud.RscOp OpInfo()
SelectedFields Method     System.Collections.Generic.List[string] SelectedFields()
ToString       Method     string ToString()
Field          Property   System.Object Field {get;set;}
Op             Property   string Op {get;set;}
Var            Property   RubrikSecurityCloud.RscGqlVars Var {get;set;}
```

### Setting Variables

The first step will be to set the filter variables for SLA Domain, SLA Time Range, and Compliance. The filter and each of the properties are their own object types. Using `Get-RscHelp` will show the type name for the filter.

```PowerShell
Get-RscHelp -Query snappableConnection
# GraphQL field: snappableConnection

Name            Type                 Description
----            ----                 -----------
API Domain                           Snappable
API Operation                        List
GQL Field                            snappableConnection
Invocation                           $query = New-RscQuery -GqlQuery snappableConnection
Var.first       Int                  Int: Int
Var.after       String               String: String
Var.last        Int                  Int: Int
Var.before      String               String: String
Var.sortOrder   SortOrder            SortOrder: https://rubrikinc.github.io/rubrik-api-documentation/schema/reference/sortorder.doc.html
Var.sortBy      SnappableSortByEnum  SnappableSortByEnum: https://rubrikinc.github.io/rubrik-api-documentation/schema/reference/snappablesortbyenum.doc.html
Var.filter      SnappableFilterInput SnappableFilterInput: https://rubrikinc.github.io/rubrik-api-documentation/schema/reference/snappablefilterinput.doc.html
Field           SnappableConnection  https://rubrikinc.github.io/rubrik-api-documentation/schema/reference/snappableconnection.doc.html
All Fields                           $query.AllFields()
Selected Fields                      $query.SelectedFields()
Example                              $query.Example()
```

The documentation shows `Var.filter` is a type of `SnappableFilterInput`. This object can be created using `Get-RscType` and assigned to `$query.Var.filter`. Once set, use `Get-Member` to look at the object types for SlaDomain, slaTimeRange, and complianceStatus.

```PowerShell
$query.Var.filter = Get-RscType -Name SnappableFilterInput

$query.Var.filter | Get-Member

   TypeName: RubrikSecurityCloud.Types.SnappableFilterInput

Name                MemberType Definition
----                ---------- ----------
Equals              Method     bool Equals(System.Object obj)
GetHashCode         Method     int GetHashCode()
GetInputObject      Method     System.Object GetInputObject(), System.Object IInput.GetInputObject()
GetType             Method     type GetType()
ToString            Method     string ToString()
Cluster             Property   RubrikSecurityCloud.Types.CommonClusterFilterInput Cluster {get;set;}
ComplianceStatus    Property   System.Collections.Generic.List[RubrikSecurityCloud.Types.ComplianceStatusEnum] ComplianceStatus {get;set;}
ExcludedObjectTypes Property   System.Collections.Generic.List[RubrikSecurityCloud.Types.ObjectTypeEnum] ExcludedObjectTypes {get;set;}
IsLocal             Property   System.Nullable[bool] IsLocal {get;set;}
ObjectFid           Property   System.Collections.Generic.List[string] ObjectFid {get;set;}
ObjectState         Property   System.Collections.Generic.List[RubrikSecurityCloud.Types.ObjectState] ObjectState {get;set;}
ObjectType          Property   System.Collections.Generic.List[RubrikSecurityCloud.Types.ObjectTypeEnum] ObjectType {get;set;}
OrgId               Property   System.Collections.Generic.List[string] OrgId {get;set;}
ProtectionStatus    Property   System.Collections.Generic.List[RubrikSecurityCloud.Types.ProtectionStatusEnum] ProtectionStatus {get;set;}
SearchTerm          Property   string SearchTerm {get;set;}
SlaDomain           Property   RubrikSecurityCloud.Types.SnappableSlaDomainFilterInput SlaDomain {get;set;}
SlaTimeRange        Property   System.Nullable[RubrikSecurityCloud.Types.SlaComplianceTimeRange] SlaTimeRange {get;set;}
```

Properties that are lists mean multiple values can be provided as a PowerShell Array. Properties with Enum in the name indicate they are enumerations, a set of constant values. To set enum variables, use the enum type name shown, followed by `::` and then the value. The values can be tab completed. Note that `ComplianceStatus` is an array, so it is encapsulated it with PowerShell array syntax `@()` and additional values could be added.

```PowerShell
$query.Var.filter.SlaTimeRange = [RubrikSecurityCloud.Types.SlaComplianceTimeRange]::LAST_24_HOURS
$query.Var.filter.ComplianceStatus = @([RubrikSecurityCloud.Types.ComplianceStatusEnum]::OUT_OF_COMPLIANCE)
```

Setting the `SlaDomain` variable requires creating the SLA filter object, and setting the ID.

```PowerShell
$query.Var.filter.SlaDomain = Get-RscType -Name SnappableSlaDomainFilterInput
# The ID can be added dynamically instead of hardcoding: Get-RscSla -Name "Gold"
$query.Var.filter.SlaDomain.id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

`$query.var.filter` should now look like this

```PowerShell
$query.var.filter

ProtectionStatus    :
SlaDomain           : RubrikSecurityCloud.Types.SnappableSlaDomainFilterInput
ComplianceStatus    : {OUT_OF_COMPLIANCE}
ObjectType          :
ExcludedObjectTypes :
Cluster             :
SearchTerm          :
SlaTimeRange        : LAST_24_HOURS
OrgId               :
ObjectState         :
IsLocal             :
ObjectFid           :
```

### Verifying Fields

To verify the fields you've selected, look at `$query.field.nodes`. Note the placeholder values that were added to the fields that were selected. The placeholder values have no meaning.

```PowerShell
$query.field.nodes | Format-List *
```

### Selecting Additional Fields

To set additional fields to be retrieved, first use `Get-Member` on the first element of `$query.field.nodes`. The nodes property is an array of objects that will be returned.

```PowerShell
$query.field.nodes[0] | Get-Member
```

Warning

Always check the type! Some queries with Implementations (sub-types) use different elements for different object types. For instance for the `slaDomains` query, `nodes[0]` contains the fiels for the `ClusterSlaDomain` type, and `nodes[1]` contains the fields for the `GlobalSlaReply` type.

To add an additional field, create a placeholder value of the object type. For example, `UsedBytes` is a `Long`, so a valid placeholder value would be `1` or `100000`. `PullTime` is a `DateTime`, so a valid placeholder value would be `"1900/01/01"`.

```PowerShell
$query.field.nodes[0].UsedBytes = 1
```

### Executing the Query

Passing the query into `Invoke-Rsc` will execute the query against the RSC API. Store the result in a variable and view the contents. The response will contain the `nodes` array of objects were requested. Note that not all queries are 'connection' queries with `nodes`.

```PowerShell
$result = Invoke-Rsc $query
$result

Count       : 36
Aggregation :
Edges       :
Nodes       : {foo, vm123, mailbox…}
PageInfo    : RubrikSecurityCloud.Types.PageInfo
```

Alternatively, you can use the `invoke()` method on the query object and immediately output the nodes array.

```PowerShell
$query.invoke().nodes
```
