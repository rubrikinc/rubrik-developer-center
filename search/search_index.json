This means you can \"ask\" the API about itself, and there is no separate process for building documentation. The schema is the documentation. Along with built-in documentation, GraphQL is strongly-typed, which means you don't have to guess the format of the arguments to an API call. Understanding object structure is a common issue with REST.</li> <li>Performance - Rubrik has a LOT of metadata available to you. Generally you'll find that REST APIs give you every property back from an object, whether you needed it or not. This can cause performance issues and much higher complexity at scale. GraphQL allows you to select just the properties you need.

We run a named query which is much like a SQL table. We then select the properties called fields, which are like columns in that table. Now, I won't get too complex at this point, but some of those properties are objects that may have their own properties.</p> <p>Here's an example.
