| authorizedOperations | [[Operation](../enums/Operation.md)!]! | The authorized operations on the object. |
| cdmPendingObjectPauseAssignment | [PendingObjectPauseAssignmentStatus](../enums/PendingObjectPauseAssignmentStatus.md) | Object pause pending assignment details for CDM objects. |
| cluster | [Cluster](Cluster.md)! | Rubrik cluster where this object originated. |
| configuredSlaDomain | [SlaDomain](../interfaces/SlaDomain.md)! | SLA Domain configured for the hierarchy object. |
| copyOnly | Boolean! | CopyOnly flag of the availability group. |
| crossAccountReplicatedObjectInfos | [[CrossAccountReplicatedObjectInfo](CrossAccountReplicatedObjectInfo.md)!] | Cross-account objects either replicated by this object or related to this object by replication. |
| descendantConnection | [MssqlAvailabilityGroupDescendantTypeConnection](MssqlAvailabilityGroupDescendantTypeConnection.md)! | List of descendants. |
| effectiveRetentionSlaDomain | [SlaDomain](../interfaces/SlaDomain.md) | Effective retention of the SLA Domain of the hierarchy object. |
| effectiveSlaDomain | [SlaDomain](../interfaces/SlaDomain.md)! | Effective SLA Domain of the hierarchy object. |
| effectiveSlaSourceObject | [PathNode](PathNode.md) | Path node of the effective SLA Domain source. |
| hasLogConfigFromSla | Boolean! | Boolean flag indicating if the availability group derives log backup configurations from SLA. |
| hostLogRetention | [Long](../scalars/Long.md)! | Interval, in seconds, between the deletion of archived log files whose 'nextTime' field specifies a time longer than this interval. To specify an interval, enter a positive integer. To immediately delete archived log files regardless of age, specify an interval of -1. To preserve all archived log files, specify an interval of -2. |
| id | [UUID](../scalars/UUID.md)! | ID of the hierarchy object. |
| instances | [[MssqlInstance](MssqlInstance.md)!]! | The list of instances associated with an availability group. |
| latestUserNote | [LatestUserNote](LatestUserNote.md) | Latest user note information. |
| logBackupFrequencyInSeconds | [Long](../scalars/Long.md)! | Number of seconds between two log backups. When the value is set to 0, log backups are not enabled. When the value is set to -1, the default log backup frequency of the Rubrik cluster is used. When the value is set to -2, the log backup frequency is derived from the SLA Domain. |
| logBackupRetentionInHours | Int! | Number of hours to retain a log backup. When the value is set to -1, the Rubrik cluster retains the log backup until the database snapshots that precede the log backup have expired. When the value is set to -2, the default log backup retention of the Rubrik cluster is used. When the value is set to -3, the log backup retention is derived from the SLA Domain. |
| logicalChildConnection | [MssqlAvailabilityGroupLogicalChildTypeConnection](MssqlAvailabilityGroupLogicalChildTypeConnection.md)! | List of logical children. |
| logicalPath | [[PathNode](PathNode.md)!]! | Sequential list of the logical ancestors of this object. |
| name | String! | Name of the hierarchy object. |
| numWorkloadDescendants | Int! | Number of descendant workloads of this object. |
| objectPauseStatus | [ObjectPauseStatus](ObjectPauseStatus.md) | Pause status of the hierarchy object. |
| objectType | [HierarchyObjectTypeEnum](../enums/HierarchyObjectTypeEnum.md)! | Type of this object. |
| pendingObjectDeletionStatus | [PendingSnapshotsOfObjectDeletion](PendingSnapshotsOfObjectDeletion.md) | Mapping from object ID to pending object deletion status. |
| pendingSla | [SlaDomain](../interfaces/SlaDomain.md) | SLA Domain assignment of the object during the process of being communicated over to Rubrik CDM. |
| physicalPath | [[PathNode](PathNode.md)!]! | Sequential list of the physical ancestors of this object. |
| primaryClusterLocation | [DataLocation](DataLocation.md)! | The source cluster of this object. Returned as a data location because there is no guarantee that Rubrik has knowledge about the source cluster. |
| replicatedObjectCount | Int! | The number of objects either replicated by this object or related to this object by replication. |
| replicatedObjects | [[CdmHierarchyObject](../interfaces/CdmHierarchyObject.md)!]! | Objects either replicated by this object or related to this object by replication. |
| securityMetadata | [SecurityMetadata](SecurityMetadata.md) | Security posture metadata. |
| slaAssignment | [SlaAssignmentTypeEnum](../enums/SlaAssignmentTypeEnum.md)! | SLA Domain assignment type for this object. |
| slaPauseStatus | Boolean! | Pause status of the effective SLA Domain of the hierarchy object. |
| snapshotDistribution | [SnapshotDistribution](SnapshotDistribution.md)! | Distribution of the snapshots of the hierarchy object. |
